# OpenAppsStore (OAS) v0.1r1
This is the first version of my application for Windows, called, well you guessed, OpenAppsStore or OAS for short! It is made in python, to help you install applications like the popular tool Ninite.
It is very basic at the moment but more features will be added soon so don't panic!
Feel free to test it out!
